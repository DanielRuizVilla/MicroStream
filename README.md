Streaming app based in GStreamer framework and Python language. It was created for my FDP (Final Degree Project).

Technologies used:

  - QT (User interface of the program)
  - Python (programming language)
  - PySide2 (python bindings for QT)
  - GStreamer (multimedia framework)
  - DASH (Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP)
  - GPAC MP4Box (Video tool, it help us to manipulate and fragment the videos)
  - Apache Server (the server will let us store some videos locally)
  
The main objective was to study the adaptive bitrate for streaming over HTTP, using DASH. This project does not contain an user guide, since it was designed for study use.
